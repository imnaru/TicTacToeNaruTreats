Naru’s Treats (Tic Tac Toe) is a delightful two-player game inspired of “Sonny Angel” figurines. In this version, players alternate turns to place their sweet-themed symbols (pretzel and donut) on a 3x3 grid using Java Programming Language. The objective is to align three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before their opponent does. This playful twist on the classic game combines strategic thinking with a touch of sugary fun, making every move a treat!

The game manages errors in a thorough manner. The try-catch is used for file operations to handle issues like missing files or access problems. Images’ dimensions and UI elements are carefully scaled and positioned to fit the game board and avoid misalignments. Also, it implemented event handling to respond correctly to user actions, such as action and mouse clicks, and to manage window events for file operations. These strategies ensure a smooth and reliable gaming experience.
